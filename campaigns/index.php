				<p>The prime concern of the Village Service Trust has been the development of Women and Children. However, we are devoted to the all-round development of villages through community building projects.</p>
<p>The VST is committed to delivering health, education and justice to the socially excluded. In particular, street children, the disabled and the elderly are supported.</p>
<p>Our campaigns aim to both mitigate the effects of poverty and to address it's underlying causes. Economic development is encouraged through schemes to help farmers and village artisans.</p>
				<p>The activities of the VST are done in close association with the health, education, and social welfare departments of the 					<a class="external" href="http://www.tn.gov.in/">state government</a> and NGOs with similar activities, ideologies and communities.</p>
				<p>Our projects have some objectives relating to the <a class="external" href="http://www.undp.org/mdg/">UN Millenium Development Goals</a>.</p>
