				<h3>Day Care Centers</h3>
				<p>In the absence of goverment operated Day care centres, many parents are forced to leave their young children at home unattended while they work in the fields. </p>
<p>To rectify this situation, the VST has established 9 day care centres in rural villages for children between the ages of 2(1/2) and 5 years. Each center is equiped with a blackboard, educational materials and toys. One teacher and one assistant care for 25 to 35 children.</p>
<p>The children are occupied with simple lessons, stories, singing, dancing and playing. They are taught good manners and habits. A nutritious meal is provided along with milk in the morning and afternoon. Parents participation in this programme is encouraged through monthly parents teachers meeting. Teachers also endeavour to visit each home regularly to discuss the child's progress with parents.</p>
