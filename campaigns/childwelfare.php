	<h5>Dindigul Town</h5>
	<p>This is one of the historic towns of Tamil Nadu. It is an industrial town noted for traditional lock and iron vault making, cigar making and the processing of skin and hide.</p>
<p>Dindigul Town is also  a vital trading center for the many surrounding villages, with a large market for agricultural products such as onions and oil.</p>
</div>

<p>This project, started in 1999, has been based in <a href="javascript:showInfoLayer('dindigul_town');" class="popup">Dindigul Town</a>, Tamil Nadu.</p>

	<h5>Street Children</h5>
<p>The goal of this project is to help children below the age of 14 or so, who have to earn their own livelihood while living on the streets.</p>

</div>

<p>The <a href="javascript:showInfoLayer('definition');" class="popup">street children</a> of Dindigul town are the beneficiaries of this project. It is estimated that 3500 children are living on the streets of Dindigul.</p>


<div class="infoLayer" id="railway_station" style="display:none">

	<h5>Railway Station</h5>
	<p>The railway station in Dindigul town is a major junction on several routes. It is also the nearest stop to the famous pilgrimage center of Palani, which attracts millions of tourists throughout the year.</p>

<p>Many arrive at the <a href="javascript:showInfoLayer('railway_station');" class="popup">railway station</a>, as the train is the easiest way of getting away from their homes. Some hope to find <a href="working_children.php">work</a> in factories and shops, or to find relatives. Others are simply thrown off the train for not having a ticket. A large number end up living on the streets around the railway, bus station and nearby temples.</p>

<p>The major problems faced by street children are:</p>
<ul class="drawers">
	<li>
	<h5 onclick="toggleInfoPane(this.parentNode)">Hazardous Labour</h5>
	<p style="display:none" class="nospace">
Street children need to work hard in order to make sufficient money for their food. Many of them work in very unhygienic conditions. Some children are moreover bonded to 	their employers and are thus unable to look for better jobs. Employers sometimes physically abuse the children.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h5 onclick="toggleInfoPane(this.parentNode)">Lack of Shelter</h5>
	<p style="display:none" class="nospace">Quite a number of street children spend their days and nights on the street.  Many lack proper shelter and are therefore vulnerable.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h5 onclick="toggleInfoPane(this.parentNode)">Sexual Abuse</h5>
	<p style="display:none" class="nospace">Street children face sexual harassment from adults and their peer group. Girls are easily exploited and are gradually introduced in to prostitution. Sexually abused children are prone to sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV / AIDS.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h5 onclick="toggleInfoPane(this.parentNode)">Drug Addiction</h5>
	<p style="display:none" class="nospace">Street children often become addicted to various substances and drugs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h5 onclick="toggleInfoPane(this.parentNode)">Law Enforcement</h5>
	<p style="display:none" class="nospace">The police view street children with suspicion and they are treated harshly. They are often arrested, taken away in police vans, beaten and put into lock-ups.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>To tackle these problems, the Village Service Trust has adopted 2 strategies:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<h5>Prevention</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>Preventing children from running away their families.</li>
			<li>Improving the quality of family life.</li>
	 		<li>Contacting children who have recently run away as early as possible and providing opportunities to leave the street.</li>
		</ul>
			

	</li>
	<li>
		<h5>Protection</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>A <a href="shelter_home.php">Shelter Home</a></li>
			<li><a href="education.php">Education and Vocational Training</a></li>
			<li><a href="health.php">Medication</a></li>
			<li>Advocacy Programmes</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
		<p>In the last 5 years, our team of dedicated and skilled staff have achieved the following 5 outcomes:</p>

	<h5>Railway Station</h5>

			<p style="display:none" class="nospace">
			We have reached out to street children soon after their arrival in the railway, bus stations and market place. Consequentially, our staff have established a friendly relationship with them. As reliable friends we have brought them to the shelter and prevented them from being abused by antisocial eliments. In all, <b>310 new arrivals have been assisted</b> so far.

			Our shelter home is answering the personal and affective needs of 83 street children.
						</li>

			<li>30 children have acquired skills in Autorickshaw diving, Typewriting, Tailoring and Doll making.</li>
			<li>We have counselled the families of 61 street children and promoted better parenting.</li>

			The attitude of the general public in Dindigul Town concerning the issue of street children is slowly changing. The VST, among others, have raised awareness of the problems and rights of street children. It is heartening to note that an increasing number of people are becoming concerned about street children and trying to respond humanly to their needs.
