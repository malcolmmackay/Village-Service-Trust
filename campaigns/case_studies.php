				<h3>Rehabilitation Programme for Disabled Children</h3>

				<h5>Case Studies of Children Assisted by the Rehabilitation Programme</h5>
				<h4>Artificial Limbs</h4>
				<p>Chandrasekar is an 11 year old boy who lost one of his legs below the knee in an accident. 
				Previously, he was having great difficulty walking with the assistance of a stick. 
				The VST helped him to get an artificial limb, which enables him to walk with more ease. 
				Artificial limbs are expensive because each one must be customised to the patient.
				His familiy are grateful for the financial assistance provided.</p>

				<h4>Tricycles for Polio Victims</h4>
				<p>Vimala is a 13 year old girl suffering from Polio. Both her legs were affected to the extent that
				she could not walk. After raising some money, the VST purchased a tricycle for her. After a few days 
				training, she is now able to ride her tricycle to school every day.</p>
				<p>Vijayalakshmi is an 11 year old girl from Paraipatty village. She is the eldest daughter of a homeless 
				and landless family. Both of her legs were affected by Polio and she could only move by crawling.
				On the advice of a doctor, we provided her with a tricycle. This has greatly increased her mobility, 
				so now the school and shops are within reach.</p>

				<h4>Hearing Aids</h4>
				<p>M. Krishnan is an 8-year-old boy with a hearing impairment and mild learning difficulties. After
				an audiogram, he was recommended a hearing aid. This was purchased by the VST and the parents were 
				taught how to operate and maintain the device.</p>
				<p>Krishnan can now hear well. However, deafness had prevented him from learning how to speak. 
				We made arrangements for speech therapy and now Krishnan is able to speak a growing number of words clearly.</p>

				<h4>Physiotherapy</h4>
				<p>Doctors recommended that the disabled children undergo physiotherapy. 
				After recruiting a physiotherapist, regular oil massages and other physical exercises 
				have greatly improved the condition of these children. </p>

				<h4>Callipers and Shoes</h4>
				<p>Rajendran is a 6-year-old boy, with both legs affected by Polio. Mobility was difficult and doctors
				advised him to use callipers, which the VST has provided. At first, he found walking difficult, but 
				after a few days training his confidence increased. He now shows few signs of difficulty when moving with his peers. </p>
