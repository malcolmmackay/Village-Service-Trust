<h2>Monitoring and Evaluation</h2>
				<h5>Internal</h5>
					<p>All programmes are monitored by the <a href="director.xhtml">Executive Director</a>.</p>
					<p>The annual review involves a meeting between the organization's staff and the people that we work with. Project outcomes are discussed thoroughly. In the case of ongoing campaigns, new objectives and action plans are chalked out for the following years.</p>
					<p>On the last Saturday of every month, the staff sit together to assess their work and to plan operations for the next month. Project evaluation reports are studied and discussed. Every 6 months, a more comprehensive review is carried out.</p>
					<p>The monthly plan is split into a weekly plan and a daily plan. These are evaluated on the 13th day of each month by the managers and project administrators.</p>
					<p>As our work involves collaborating with local community groups, they also evaluate our progress and give feedback to staff every month and every year at the annual gathering.</p>
				<h5>External</h5>
				<p>External evaluations are done by outsiders appointed jointly by the donor agency and the partner agency. This is done according to the direction of the funding agency.</p>
